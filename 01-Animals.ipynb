    "### Counting things\n",
    "\n",
    "If during class we had wanted to know how many countries were on each continent, I would use `df.continent.value_counts()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of people like to try `groupby` when you're counting things, but in pandas there is only one rule: **every time you want to count things and think you should use groupby.... don't use `groupby`!** Instead use `value_counts()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you can have strings and integers in Python, each column can have a different data type. You can run `df.dtypes` or `df.info()` to get the data types of each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int64` is an integer\n",
    "* `float64` is a float/decimal\n",
    "* `object` is *anything else*. This normally means a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also (try to) convert between types! In normal Python it might be `int(age)`, but with pandas you'll use `df.age.astype(int)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphing things\n",
    "\n",
    "Just put `.plot()` on the end of whatever you're looking at. It works like 75% of the time!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.groupby('continent').population.sum().plot(kind='barh')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above will give me a horizontal bar graph of the sum of each continent's population. Technically speaking it works because the result of the `groupby` and `sum` is a Series, matplotlib plots the index compared to the values. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a full dataframe, though, you usually need to give it the `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.plot(x='life_expectancy', y='per_capita_gdp', kind='scatter')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you a scatterplot of each country's life expectancy vs. its per-capita GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Altair, though, you can find details [on its website](https://altair-viz.github.io/). We'll cover it a lot more in the future!"
